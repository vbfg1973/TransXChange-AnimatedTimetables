# TransXChange Timetables

## Intent:

* Process TransXChange timetable format into stop -> stop sections with timings

* Find nearest point on a road segment to a stop

* Break up road network into smaller segments with nodes at nearest point to stop

* Find routes from stop -> stop using PostGIS & PGRouting and the newly created nodes

* Fully animate the bus network
